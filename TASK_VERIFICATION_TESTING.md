## 🧪 **How to Test the New Features:**

### **Prerequisites:**
1. **Servers Running:**
   - MongoDB: Default port (27017)
   - Backend: http://localhost:3000
   - Frontend: http://localhost:8080

2. **Test Accounts:**
   - Create at least 2 user accounts to test the workflow
   - User A: Task Creator
   - User B: Task Assignee

### **Step 1: Create Test Tasks**

1. **Login as User A** (Task Creator):
   - Go to: http://localhost:8080/welcomepage1.html
   - Login with User A credentials
   - Navigate to Dashboard
   - Click "Create New Task"
   - Fill in task details:
     - Title: "Test Task for Verification"
     - Description: "This is a test task to verify the completion workflow"
     - Time Window: 30 minutes
     - Location: (optional, can use location features)
     - Type: "Other"
   - Submit the task

### **Step 2: Accept Task as Different User**

1. **Logout and Login as User B** (Task Assignee):
   - Logout from User A
   - Login with User B credentials
   - Go to Dashboard
   - Find the task created by User A
   - Click "Accept Task" button
   - Task should now show status "In Progress"

### **Step 3: Test My Tasks Page**

1. **While logged in as User B:**
   - Click "My Tasks" in the sidebar navigation
   - You should see the accepted task listed
   - Task should show:
     - Status: "In Progress"
     - Role: "Assignee"
     - Creator: User A's name
     - "Mark Completed" button

### **Step 4: Complete Task (Assignee)**

1. **In My Tasks page as User B:**
   - Click "Mark Completed" button on the task
   - Add a completion note (optional): "Task completed successfully. All items delivered."
   - Submit the completion
   - Task status should change to "Awaiting Verification"
   - Toast notification should appear: "Task marked as completed! Waiting for verification."

### **Step 5: Verify Task (Creator)**

1. **Logout and Login as User A:**
   - Go to "My Tasks" page
   - Find the task you created
   - Task should show:
     - Status: "Awaiting Verification"
     - Role: "Creator"
     - Assignee: User B's name
     - Completion note from User B
     - "Verify Completion" button

2. **Verify the task:**
   - Click "Verify Completion" button
   - Review the completion details
   - Click "Verify Completion" in the modal
   - Task status should change to "Completed"
   - Toast notification: "Task verified successfully!"

### **Step 6: Test Dashboard Integration**

1. **Go back to main Dashboard:**
   - Tasks should show appropriate action buttons based on:
     - User role (creator vs assignee)
     - Task status
     - Current user permissions

2. **Expected Dashboard Buttons:**
   - **Available tasks**: "Accept Task" (for non-creators)
   - **In-progress tasks**: "Mark Completed" (for assignees only)
   - **Awaiting verification**: "Verify" (for creators only)
   - **Completed tasks**: No action buttons

### **Step 7: Test Filtering and Search**

1. **In My Tasks page:**
   - Test task type filter:
     - "All Tasks" - shows both created and assigned
     - "Tasks I Created" - shows only tasks you created
     - "Tasks Assigned to Me" - shows only tasks assigned to you
   
   - Test status filter:
     - Filter by different statuses
     - Verify correct tasks appear
   
   - Test search functionality:
     - Search by task title
     - Search by task description

### **Step 8: Test Error Handling**

1. **Permission Tests:**
   - Try to verify a task you didn't create (should fail)
   - Try to complete a task you're not assigned to (should fail)
   - Try to accept your own task (should fail)

2. **Invalid State Tests:**
   - Try to complete an already completed task
   - Try to verify a task that's not awaiting verification

## 🔍 **What to Look For:**

### **✅ Success Indicators:**
- [ ] Tasks appear correctly in My Tasks page
- [ ] Task roles (Creator/Assignee) display correctly
- [ ] Status changes reflect in real-time
- [ ] Action buttons appear based on user permissions
- [ ] Completion notes are saved and displayed
- [ ] Toast notifications appear for actions
- [ ] Filtering and search work correctly

- [ ] Invalid task IDs

## 📊 **Expected Database Changes:**

When testing, verify these changes in MongoDB:

```javascript
// Task document structure after completion:
{
  "_id": "...",
  "title": "Test Task for Verification",
  "status": "awaiting-verification", // or "verified"
  "assignedTo": "user_b_id",
  "createdBy": "user_a_id",
  "completedAt": "2025-06-24T...",
  "completionNote": "Task completed successfully...",
  "verifiedAt": "2025-06-24T..." // only after verification
}
```

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting:**

### **Common Issues:**
1. **"My Tasks" link not working:**
   - Check that my-tasks.html exists
   - Verify navigation links are updated

2. **Action buttons not appearing:**
   - Check user authentication
   - Verify task status and user permissions
   - Check console for JavaScript errors

3. **API errors:**
   - Check server logs for backend errors
   - Verify JWT tokens are valid
   - Check MongoDB connection

4. **Tasks not updating:**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify API responses
   - Try refreshing the page

### **Debug Commands:**
```bash
# Check server logs
tail -f server.log

# Check MongoDB tasks
mongo taskhive
db.tasks.find().pretty()

# Check browser console
F12 -> Console tab
```

## 🎉 **Success Criteria:**

   - Creators can verify completions
   - Assignees can mark tasks as completed
   - Proper permission enforcement

3. ✅ **My Tasks Page Works:**
   - Shows user-specific tasks
   - Filters work correctly
   - Action buttons appear appropriately

4. ✅ **Integration is Seamless:**
   - Dashboard shows new buttons

## 📞 **If You Need Help:**

1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Check server logs for API errors
3. Verify MongoDB contains expected data
4. Test with multiple browser tabs to simulate multiple users
5. Clear browser cache if experiencing issues
